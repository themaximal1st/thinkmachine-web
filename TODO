- HYPERMEDIA nodes...IMAGES/VIDEOS/AUDIO dont have media tabs...make nodes the media

- DOCS on setting up API keys



Context needs stacked nodes..what context am I in right now when editing?
Am I adding notes to all symbols or just a single symbol?
Are results consistent with what you see if you reload and import from export? All symbols get notes, but that doesn't happen until reload.
Need stable concept of UUID?

Machine Learning should connect here: /Users/brad/Downloads/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Data-Think-Machine-2024-06-06T23_26_55.744Z.csv 

Notes...instead of Generative text...let user write something
Disable AI mode..might be distracting if you're trying to do deep thinking
multiple tabs...even on web....grab UUID from URL bar?

// TODO: custom camera position with activeNode..if they zoom out it should keep that zoom
// TODO: we could technically highlight links that won't be found, and attempt to generate them..could be cool
// TODO: More control over prompt generation. Unlocks more creativity and use cases



eventually
    obsidian plugin

bug
    chat doesn't know what interwingle mode we're in...we should teach it out think machine works so it can integrate better
    every once and a while drag and drop gets weird with CSSObject


good ideas
    collapse / expand node
    forward / back button


- it should be more generative. when a link doesn't exist, generate it
- remove markdown linking...do it dynamically based on embeddings? or switch to symbols and generate from there


- how to recenter camera? is node-select a mode?
- partial-text view—click to expand and see full text. click something and zoom around
- bold/hyperlink symbols and go directly to them
- buttons to manage stuff...add/edit/remove/link/generate/chat
- if you can add a background that'd be great
- have default notes that tie everything together...but let user override or add notes
- make it so all the planes are connected.. will make everything sharper and easier to add more ui (like chat)
- more spacing in hypergraph by default
- fade node/link colors when in node-focus mode
    - in selected mode, highlight connections brighter (but not 100%)
- monochrome mode (by default?)
- eventually embeddings can be used to highlight what's related at a distance
- New content suggestion! A new node appears that suggests new content could be generated
- image generation (automatically)
function calling built in to chat..makes good suggestions
 - generate automatically goes to next one? down the rabbit hole....
- typer mode...for brainstorming and fast input..default is mouse

- bug: menu zoom bug is super annoying. after you zoom out, leave node mode?
- bug: possible to only show menu once fully zoomed?

- Text / Image / Video generation
- Free version could generate them on-the-fly
- Pro version could generate ahead of time
- Presentation mode...hide the UI buttons...just navigate through the content
