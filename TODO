new UX
- how to recenter camera? is node-select a mode?
- navigate through node-select with arrow keys
- partial-text viewâ€”click to expand
- bold/hyperlink symbols and go directly to them
- buttons to manage stuff...add/edit/remove/link/generate/chat


- linking think machine documents together --- creating a bigger web
- sharing / publishing / letting other people edit your work

- Right click a link & delete it (optionally delete a node)
- Double click seems to duplicate. Add should be inline adder which adds both so it doesn't seem duplicated
- The Help menu is empty (Windows / Mac)
- Make ` key be more refined to allow links and nodes to be selected / edited / deleted

Think Machine needs console UX refresh
Simple UX
People are confused about clicking and getting duplicates

- click mode selects a node by defualt, brings up menu?
 - inline hyperedge adder/editor/delete/chat/generate
