- it should be more generative. when a link doesn't exist, generate it
- remove markdown linking...do it dynamically based on embeddings? or switch to symbols and generate from there

new UX
 - embed external media / search google / youtube for references?

- how to recenter camera? is node-select a mode?
- navigate through node-select with arrow keys
- partial-text view—click to expand and see full text. click something and zoom around
- bold/hyperlink symbols and go directly to them
- buttons to manage stuff...add/edit/remove/link/generate/chat
- if you can add a background that'd be great
- have default notes that tie everything together...but let user override or add notes
- make it so all the planes are connected.. will make everything sharper and easier to add more ui (like chat)
- more spacing in hypergraph by default
- fade node/link colors when in node-focus mode
    - in selected mode, highlight connections brighter (but not 100%)
- monochrome mode (by default?)
- eventually embeddings can be used to highlight what's related at a distance
- New content suggestion! A new node appears that suggests new content could be generated
- image generation (automatically)
- rethink whole UI
 - drop top "input modes"
 - clicking on canvas should bring up menu natively
 - keep interwingle
 - keep depth
 - rethink settings menu / icons at bottom
 - rethink context / search
 - weird idea: when you build context it builds multi-node selector. text from both. images from both. too granular?
 - weird idea: build a tutorial on the fly from the knowledge graph
 - weird idea: create a game / puzzle that can only be solved by exploring
 - function calling built in to chat..makes good suggestions (clippy)
- click to generate just generates one, quickly. press multiple times to generate
 - generate automatically goes to next one? down the rabbit hole....
- typer mode...for brainstorming and fast input..default is mouse

- bug: menu zoom bug is super annoying. after you zoom out, leave node mode?
- bug: possible to only show menu once fully zoomed?

- Text / Image / Video generation
- Free version could generate them on-the-fly
- Pro version could generate ahead of time
- Presentation mode...hide the UI buttons...just navigate through the content


- linking think machine documents together --- creating a bigger web
- sharing / publishing / letting other people edit your work

- Right click a link & delete it (optionally delete a node)
- Double click seems to duplicate. Add should be inline adder which adds both so it doesn't seem duplicated
- The Help menu is empty (Windows / Mac)
- Make ` key be more refined to allow links and nodes to be selected / edited / deleted

Think Machine needs console UX refresh
Simple UX
People are confused about clicking and getting duplicates

- click mode selects a node by defualt, brings up menu?
 - inline hyperedge adder/editor/delete/chat/generate
